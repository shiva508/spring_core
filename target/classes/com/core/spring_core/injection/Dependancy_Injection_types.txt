There are three possible ways of DI in Spring

Constructor-based: should be used for mandatory dependencies. In constructor, we should assign constructor args to final member fields.

Setter-based: Should be used for optional dependencies.

Field-based: Spring discourages the use of this because it would possibly hide mandatory fields from outside which would otherwise be
			assigned in the constructor. This would take away the advantage of properly initialized POJO, specially if intended to use outside of 
			Spring container. Even though, we are mostly using field based injection in this series of tutorials to simplify the concept we want
 			to deliver, we suggest the developers to always avoid using field-based DI in real project scenarios.
